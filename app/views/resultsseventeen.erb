        <p>The spread of the Zika virus throughout the Americas and the resulting Zika fever epidemic caused worldwide alarm. The effects of Zika are so extreme that health officials have urged women in affected areas to delay pregnancy anywhere between six months and two years. Zika is not just a threat to health; it threatens economic growth due to reduced tourism. Thankfully in November 2016, the World Health Organization announced the end of the epidemic, though Zika is still a major concern.</p>
