        <p>The human genome sequence and the preliminary analysis result were revealed on February 12 jointly by scientists from China, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and the United States, and Celera Genomics, a U.S. company. The human genome was proved to contain some 30,000 to 40,000 genes consisting of 3.2 billion alkali base pairs. This was another major step in exploring the mystery inside the human being. It was estimated that the work of mapping the entire human genome can be finished by the year 2003.</p>
